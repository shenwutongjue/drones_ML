# drones_ML
ML models
- updated csv dataframe needs to go into data file
- 2 hand_motion file are exactly the same
- Models file includes trained ML models.
- added glove.ipynb and glove.py for real-time glove input predicting


- .ipynb for jupyter notbook
- .py for python script

How to use:
1. open hand_motion.ipynb.
2. add lines to the desired model (current code pickled the KNN model).
3. run the code, you can stop after pickled the desired model.
4. open glove.ipynb, make sure that the model and the scaler import successfully.
5. run the second cell if testing with the glove; run other cells below if testing with hard-coded data.
